#Program  "ReconstructFDist"
Is a Fortran console applicatoin that aims to deal with particle size distribution inversion algorithm.
There is two different ways to execute the program:

- to start program in generation mode, when it prepares a databank of inversion matrices.
- to start program in solver regime to obtain particle size distribution finction for the given 
  aerosol optical characeristics.
